# JavaScript Functions

## Getting Started

You will be doing the function exercises in the JavaScript section of your code editor. For each exercise please put the instructions above each exercise. Example:

```
// Create a function that adds 2 numbers together
function add(num1, num2) {
    console.log(num1 + num2);
};
```

## Exercises

### Part I

Please console log your inside of your functions.

1.  Declare three variables called `num1`, `num2`, `num3` and store a Number value to each variable.

2.  Create a function called `multiply` that will multiply the `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` variables.

3.  Create a function called `addThenSubtract`. Inside of your function declare a variable that will store the `sum` of `num1` and `num3`. Next, you will subtract `num2` from your `sum` variable.

4.  Create a function called `subtractThenMultiply`. Inside of your function declare a variable that will store the `difference` of `num2` and `num3`. Next, you will multiply `num1` to the value stored in the `difference` variable.

5.  Create a function called `divideThenAdd`. Inside of your function declare a variable that will store the `quotient` of `num1` and `num2`. Next, you will add `num3` to the value stored in the `quotient` variable.

6.  Create a function called `multipyThenDivide`. Inside of your function declare a variable that will store the `product` of `num2` and `num3`. Next, you will divide `num1` from the value stored in `product`.

7.  Create a function called `divide`. Your function should produce the remainder of `num1` and `num3`. \*Hint: You can use the modulus % operator to get the remainder of two numbers.

8.  Create a function called `subtractThenAdd`. Inside of your function declare a variable that will store the `difference` of `num1` and `num2`. Next, you will add `num3` to the value stored in the `difference` variable.

9.  Declare a variable called `name` with a String value. Next, create a function called `mathChamp` that will produce the following sentence: `-name- has won -num2- math decathlons.` You will be using the `num2` variable that you created previously.

10. Declare a variable called `sport` with a String value. Next, create a function called `winner`. Inside of the function create a variable called `sum` that will add the `num1` and `num2` variables. Next, produce the following sentence: `My school has won -sum- -sport- games this season.`
