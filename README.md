# JavaScript Functions

## Getting Started

You will be doing the function exercises in the JavaScript section of your code editor. Console log inside of your functions. Don't forget to invoke your functions.

Example:

```
var addTwoNums = 5 + 3;

function addThenSubtract(sum, num) {
    console.log(sum - num);
};

add(addTwoNums, 2);
```

## Exercises

### Part I

When invoking your functions you will have to either pass in the variable you created with each exercise and a number of your choice or pass in your own arguments.

1.  Create a function called `multiply` with two parameters `num1` and `num2`. This function should multiply `num1` by `num2`.

2.  Declare a variable called `sumOfNums` and store the sum of two numbers of your choice. Next, create a function called `subtractFromSum` with two parameters `sum` and `num`. Using the function parameters subtract `num` from `sum`.

3.  Declare a variable called `diffOfNums` and store the difference of two numbers of your choice. Next, create a function called `subtractThenMultiply` with two parameters `diff` and `num`. Using the function parameters multiply `num` by `diff`.

4.  Declare a variable called `quotientOfNums` and store the quotient of two numbers of your choice. Next, create a function called `addToQuotient` with two parameters `quotient` and `num`. Using the function parameters, add `num` to `quotient`.

5.  Declare a variable called `productOfNums` that will store the product of two numbers of your choice. Next, create a function called `multipyThenDivide` with two parameters `product` and `num`. Using the function parameters divide `product` by `num`.

6.  Create a function called `divide` with two parameters `num1` and `num2`. Your function should produce the remainder of `num1` and `num3`. \*Hint: You can use the modulus % operator to get the remainder of two numbers.

7.  Declare a variable called `getDiffOfNums` that will store the difference of two numbers of your choice. Create a function called `addToDiff` with two parameters `diff` and `num`. Using the function parameters add `num` to `diff`.

8.  Create a function called `mathChamp` with two parameters `name` and `num`. Using the function parameters create the following sentence: `-name- has won -num- math decathlons.` \*Hint: You will need to pass a String value for `name` when invoking your function.

9.  Create a function called `winner` with three parameters `num1`, `num2`, and `sport`. Using the function parameters create the following sentence: `My school has won -num1- + -num2- -sport- games this season.`

10. Create a function called `lottery` with two parameters `location` and `name`. Using the function parameers create the following sentence: `The winner of the million dollar raffle is -name-. Please redeem your prize at -location-.`
